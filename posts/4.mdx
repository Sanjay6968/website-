# MANUFACTURING SHOWDOWN  -  A **Battle** between **3D Printing** & **Traditional Manufacturing**

3D printing offers a wide range
of unparalleled characteristics which makes it exclusive let's start with
production speed if we carefully observe the production process and its sprint
in both processes, we find that 3D printing is more prompt compared to
traditional processes. These are generally slow processes as they are
subtractive, formative, and even require frequent tool changes and lead time is
also high therefore in this case 3D Printing takes an upper hand.

Wait for a while it's not over yet! we will now consider that flexibility and
pliancy gain an upper hand in 3D printing, this is because of various
manufacturing constraints to the traditional processes, if we take a look at 3D
printing it is not constrained as much as the former one due to which this
stage is also lead by 3D printing.

Currently,mass production, strength, durability, and regulatory compliance are the
sectors dominated by traditional methods but it won't be so in the near future
because the 3D printing sector is developing at a phenomenal pace and even
embedding Machine Learning which gives us the hope to raise up as early as
possible. Traditional methods outmanoeuvre 3D Printing at this stage.

Post-processing and waste generation are comparatively less in 3D printing and even the waste
can be reused to generate gallery or other showcase items in the case of 3D
printing by converting waste into pellets through a pellet extruder but in
traditional methods it’s not the case they require extensive finishing, and
much wastage is produced.

Finally, it is time to conclude
the Battle’s result as in the case of Batch production 3D printing surpasses
traditional methods while if it’s the case of cost-effective mass production,
compliance, and speed in some cases such as injection moulding, die casting
etc. traditional methods establish supremacy.
