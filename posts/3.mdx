# Basis for classification of 3D printing

printing technologies can be broadly classified based on various criteria such
that each one of them highlights unique aspects of the processes. Below are the
following common bases for the classification of 3D printing:

---

**Process/Technology** **:  In this criterion, classification is based on the underlying technology or process.

**Material type:** a classification of 3D printing processes based on the type of
materials they use.

**Material State:** a classification of the 3D printing
process based on material state.

**Layering Approach:** a classification of 3D printing based on the addition
of layers.

**Resolution/Detail Level:** a classification of 3D printing based
on resolution or detail level

**Application Area:** a classification of 3D printing based on primary
application Areas.

**Material Processing:** It's classified based on the way the
material is processed.

**Industrial/Consumer:** It's classified based on their typical
usage in industrial, desktop or consumer usage.

**Biocompatibility:** classification of 3d printers based on their
compatibility for producing biocompatible 3d printers.

**Post Processing Requirements:** classification based on their post
processing requirements.

**Production Volume:** a classification based on production
volume suited to different scales of production

**Print speed:** Printers can be classified based on their print speeds into
various categories, ranging from slower desktop printers to faster industrial
and production-grade machines. Keep in mind that print speed is influenced by
factors like layer height, complexity of the object, and chosen print settings.
Here's a classification based on print speeds.
