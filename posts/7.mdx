## Introduction

Laser cutting is a precision manufacturing process that has revolutionized the way various materials are cut and shaped across a multitude of industries. Using a high-powered laser beam, laser cutting technology enables the precise and efficient cutting of materials such as metal, plastic, wood, fabric, and more. This process is guided by computer numerical control (CNC) systems, allowing for intricate and complex designs to be executed with remarkable accuracy.

The fundamental principle behind laser cutting involves focusing a **concentrated beam of light**, typically a laser, onto the surface of the material to be cut. The intense heat generated by the laser melts, burns, or vaporizes the material, creating a clean and precise cut along the desired path. The speed, intensity, and focus of the laser beam are carefully controlled to achieve the desired cut, making laser cutting a highly versatile and adaptable manufacturing technique.
