      A 3D printer is a machine that creates 3-dimensional objects by addition of materials in a layer-by-layer fashion. 
      It is based on the process of additive manufacturing. 3D printer works by taking in the 3D model designed in any modeling software, 
      which is then sliced using special slicing software’s into layers which are readable by 3D printers. Know the printer starts printing 
      as the design is provided in a layer-by-layer fashion till the object is completely printed which is then post processed to ensure 
      objects quality and stability.
